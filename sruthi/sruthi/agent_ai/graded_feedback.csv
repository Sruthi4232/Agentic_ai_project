124,A,"The main function of mitochondria is  to produce energy 
in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the cell through cellular 
respiration.  They are also involved in other vital processes, including regulating cell 
death (apoptosis), calcium storage, and promoting cell growth and multiplication.   
Primary functions  
• Energy production:   
Mitochondria are known as the ""powerhouses"" of the cell because they convert 
chemical energy from nutrients like glucose into ATP, the main energy currency for the 
cell. This is achieved through a process called cellular respiration.   
• Metabolic regulation:   
They help regulate the overall metabolic activity of the cell, including the metabolism of 
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.   
• Cellular signaling:   
Mitochondria play a role in regulating calcium storage, which is essential for many 
cellular signaling pathways.","**Strengths:**
- Answer is highly relevant to the question.
- Good explanation length, showing sufficient detail.

**Improvements:**
- None listed",9
